## Requirements

### General

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file`  should print 2)
-   All your files should end with a new line ([why?](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789))
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/bin/bash`
-   A  `README.md`  file at the root of the  `holberton-system_engineering-devops`  repo, containing a description of the repository
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of  _this_  project, describing what each script is doing
-   You are not allowed to use backticks,  `&&`,  `||`  or  `;`
-   All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the  `chmod`  command:  `chmod u+x file`. Later, well learn more about how to utilize this command.
